## Start in App.js
This app has notes in all of the relevant components about what the application is doing.
The components we should care about are

### App.js
does nothing, just renders Parent.js
### Parent.js
stores our "name" piece of state
### FuncComponent.js
takes in some props and has a button to update the name state of Parent.js to be Adam
### ClassComponent.js
takes in some props and has an input field/button to update the name state of Parent.js to be whatever is typed into the input field
